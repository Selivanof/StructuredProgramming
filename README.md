## Project Overview
As part of the Structured Programming course, I created a local multiplayer game for 1-4 players. It uses the windows console to output the game to the player. Players can choose between 3 different ships (each with a unique advantage) and 3 difficulty levels (that affect the enviroment). Winds can influence the ship's movement, making it harder to reach the goal.

## Project Requirements
* Game Type: Round based game with one or more players; in each round the players define their move; the moves are executed for all players at the same time.
* Play Area: A large lake with a large island; it has wide and narrow passages between the shores.
* Game: The direction and the intensity of the wind changes on each round. Variable and strong wind means increased difficulty. Each player determines the direction and range of his/her movement. The program calculates with specific rules and with a some randomness (which can be changed depending on the desired difficulty) the cruising and the next point that each boat reaches. Optionally, each player's boats can collide with each other.
* Winner: Whoever reaches the finish line first, completing a full cruising around the island.

## Project Report
The full report/manual of the project can be found in [this pdf file]() (note that the file is in Greek).

## Project Grade
The project received the maximum grade of 1.0/1.0. It also received a +1.5 bonus for being one of the top 3 projects of the class.
